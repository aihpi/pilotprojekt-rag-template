"""Check that everything this app needs is reachable, and say what to fix.

Run this when something does not work. It answers the question that otherwise costs

Each model is tried several times on purpose. The failure that misleads people is not
"it broke" but "it broke sometimes": a connection that loses one request in three lets
a single chat message through while making a document import fail dozens of times. One
