"""Parser interface: a data source -> a list of :class:`Section`.

A parser owns its own file iteration (globbing a directory or reading a single
file) so format-specific logic (e.g. the Docling-JSON section reconstruction,
which spans a whole directory) stays inside the parser.

``Section.metadata`` uses the flat keys the retrieval/citation layer reads
(``source_file``/``file``/``source``, ``title``/``section_title``,
``page_start``/``page_end``, plus arbitrary extras). ``doc_id`` is a stable
string; the ingestion pipeline derives each Qdrant point id from it, so keeping
it deterministic keeps re-ingests idempotent.

    would be pointless work, while a handful of stat calls is free. It is a
