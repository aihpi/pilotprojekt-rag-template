#### Note & instructions:

##### Commit message title and PR title rules

We use [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) — see
[CONTRIBUTING.md](../CONTRIBUTING.md#commits):

```
<type>(<optional scope>): <imperative subject, no capital, no dot at the end>
```

`type` is one of `feat`, `fix`, `docs`, `test`, `refactor`, `perf`, `chore`, `ci`.
Use the scope for the area you touched (`config`, `kb`, `tools`, `images`, `ui`, …),
and append `!` (or a `BREAKING CHANGE:` footer) when a config or data layout has to
be migrated. Keep the subject under ~72 characters.

_examples_:
```
feat(kb): add semantic chunking strategy
fix(#29): normalize Unicode hyphens in keyword dedup
refactor!: drop IT-Grundschutz legacy and orphaned code
```

Reference the issue number in the scope (`fix(#29):`) or in the body — the PR id is
appended by GitHub on squash merge, so do not put it in the title yourself.

_note_: this title is important — it lands in the git history, is displayed in our
editors and is what makes the change understandable later.
