# Modular RAG Template

**🇩🇪 [Deutsche Version](README.de.md)** · 📖 **[Documentation](https://aihpi.github.io/pilotprojekt-rag-template/)**

A chat assistant that answers questions about **your own documents**, and shows
you the exact page each answer came from.

You give it a folder of PDFs. It reads them, and from then on you can ask
questions in normal language. Every answer links back to the source, so you can
check it yourself.

Setting it up means editing **one settings file**. You do not need to write any
code.

> **It works straight away.** Three research papers come with the project
> ([sources & licence](apps/chainlit/data/documents/SOURCES.md)), so you can try
> a working assistant before you change anything.

<details>
<summary><b>Which tools this is built on</b></summary>

[Chainlit](https://chainlit.io) for the chat window, [LiteLLM](https://litellm.ai)
to talk to the AI models, [Qdrant](https://qdrant.tech) to store the searchable
text, and [Docling](https://github.com/DS4SD/docling) to read PDFs.
</details>

## What you need

Only three things on your machine:

| | |
|---|---|
| **[Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)** | Runs everything. On Windows it uses WSL2, which Docker Desktop sets up for you. |
| **Git** | To download the project. If you would rather not install it, use the green *Code* button on GitHub and pick *Download ZIP*. |
| **A text editor** | To fill in one settings file. Any editor works. |

**You do not need** Python, uv, pip, Node, Qdrant or PostgreSQL. Those are all
inside the container.

**One thing is not included: the AI model.** The project ships the chat app, the
database and the search index, but no model. You point it at an existing service
by putting an address and a key into the `.env` file. That can be a service your
organisation provides, or a model server running on your own machine.

## Quickstart

Copy these lines into a terminal, one block at a time:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/aihpi/pilotprojekt-rag-template.git
cd pilotprojekt-rag-template/apps/chainlit

cp .env.example .env            # put your gateway URL + API key in .env
docker compose up -d --build    # starts everything
```

The second command copies a template for your settings. Open the new `.env` file
and fill in the address and key for your AI service. The last command starts the
assistant, which takes a few minutes the first time.

Then open <http://localhost:8000> and log in with `admin` / `admin`. Change that
password before anyone else can reach the app.

The assistant starts out with the three example papers already loaded, and all
features switched on. Its settings are in
[`examples/papers/rag.config.yaml`](apps/chainlit/examples/papers/rag.config.yaml),
which is a good file to look at first.

<details>
<summary><b>Without Docker</b></summary>

```bash
cd apps/chainlit
uv sync                                   # use uv, not pip (see Updating below)
docker run -p 6333:6333 qdrant/qdrant     # storage for the searchable text

export RAG_CONFIG=examples/papers/rag.config.yaml
uv run python -m kb.ingest                # read the documents in
uv run chainlit run app.py                # http://localhost:8000
```
</details>

> **Which AI models to use.** The example uses freely available models
> (`gpt-oss-120b`, `octen-embedding-8b`, and `gemma-4-31b` for reading images).
> Nothing here ties you to a paid provider.
>
> Model names differ from service to service, so the names above may not work
> with yours. Ask your service which models it offers, then write those names
> into the settings file. The file lists more open alternatives in a comment
> (Qwen3, Llama 3.x, Mistral, BGE-M3, multilingual-E5).

## Updating to a newer version

Already have it running and want the latest changes? Three lines.

**With Docker (the usual way):**

```bash
git pull
cd apps/chainlit
docker compose up -d --build
```

The `--build` at the end matters. Without it, Docker starts your **old** app again and
you will not see any of the changes, and no error warns you. Rebuilding takes about
half a minute. (`make up` does the same thing.)

**Without Docker:**

```bash
git pull
cd apps/chainlit
uv sync
```

Use `uv sync`, not `pip install -e .`. Pip picks different versions of some packages,
and the app can fail to start.

Then open <http://localhost:8000> and ask a question. Click one of the sources under the
answer and the PDF should open on the right. That is the quickest way to see it worked.

### Good to know

- **Nothing you added gets deleted.** Your documents, indexed data and chat history all
  survive an update, so you normally do not need to ingest again. New or edited files in
  the documents folder are read in by themselves on the next start.
- **One exception.** If an earlier ingest reported failed figure descriptions, read your
  documents in once more so those figures get described. Only worth doing if you saw
  those errors: [Figures & images](docs/images.md).
- **The very first document import is slow.** The app downloads the models it uses to read
  PDFs (roughly 500 MB). They are kept afterwards, so this happens once, not once per
  update.
- **Old versions take up disk space.** Free it up with `docker image prune`.
- **Something acting up?** Stop everything and start fresh:
  `docker compose down && docker compose up -d --build`

## Use your own documents

First make your own copy of the settings file, so the examples stay intact:

```bash
cp apps/chainlit/examples/papers/rag.config.yaml apps/chainlit/my-rag.yaml
```

1. Put your PDFs into `apps/chainlit/data/documents/`. They stay on your machine.
   Only the example papers belong to the project, and you can delete them.
2. Open `my-rag.yaml` and give `vector_store.collection` a new name. This keeps
   your documents separate from the examples.
3. Let the app read your documents:
   `RAG_CONFIG=my-rag.yaml docker compose up -d`

It also handles Markdown, JSON and CSV files. See
[Adding your data](docs/adding-data.md).

**Changing your documents later** is the same step again. The folder decides what
the assistant knows: add a file and only that one is read, correct a file and it is
read again, delete a file and it stops appearing in answers. Replacing the whole set
at once works too. Everything else is left untouched, so you do not pay for it
twice.

## What you configure

Everything lives in one settings file. These are its sections:

| Section | What it controls |
|---|---|
| `models` | which AI models to use, and which ones users can pick in the app |
| `vector_store` | where the searchable text is stored |
| `data_sources[]` | where your documents are and what type they are |
| `chunking` | how documents get cut into pieces before they are searched |
| `retrieval` | how many pieces to look up for each question |
| `tools` | what the assistant is allowed to do besides searching → [more](docs/tools.md) |
| `images` | what happens with pictures and charts in your PDFs → [more](docs/images.md) |
| `citation` | how a source reference looks under an answer |
| `prompt` | the instructions the assistant follows, and the example questions → [more](docs/prompts.md) |
| `app` | appearance and behaviour of the chat window |

Every single option is listed in [Configuration](docs/configuration.md).

## Features

- **The assistant decides how to look things up.** Besides plain search it can
  list all documents, read a whole document (needed for summaries), fetch more
  text around a hit, or double-check a claim. You choose which of these it may
  use. → [docs](docs/tools.md)
- **Pictures and charts are included, not skipped.** They are described in words,
  so they can be found by a search, and a relevant figure is shown right above
  the paragraph that discusses it. → [docs](docs/images.md)
- **Tables are kept.** They stay part of the text instead of being thrown away.
- **Every claim has a source.** Click it and the original PDF opens at the right
  page.
- **The assistant can write its own instructions.** If you do not write them
  yourself, it creates them from your documents when it starts.
  → [docs](docs/prompts.md)
- **Users can switch models and edit instructions** in the settings panel, and
  their choice is remembered.
- **Chat history, thumbs up/down and exports**, with GitHub or local login.

## How it fits together

Your documents are read, cut into pieces and stored so they can be searched. When
someone asks a question, the matching pieces are looked up and handed to the AI
model, which writes an answer with sources.

```
                        rag.config.yaml
                               │
  documents ──► kb/parsers ──► kb/chunkers ──► embeddings ──► Qdrant
  (pdf/md/json/csv/custom)                                      │
                                                                ▼
  Chainlit UI ◄── citations ◄── answer ◄── LLM + tools ◄── retrieval
```

Each step is one small folder you can extend with a single new file: document
types in `kb/parsers/`, ways of cutting text in `kb/chunkers/`, and abilities in
`tools/`. → [Extending](docs/extending.md)

## Limitations

- **This is a prototype.** It has not been security-checked, so look it over
  before using it with sensitive data or real users.
- **Sources and follow-up questions only work in German.** The app looks for
  German wording (`Quelle N: … (S.x)`, `Anschlussfragen:`), so set `language: de`
  for those two features. Your documents themselves can be in any language.
- **Describing pictures costs money.** With `images.mode: describe`, every figure
  is sent to an AI model once while your documents are being read in.
- **Changing the model that indexes your text means reading everything in again**
  (`--recreate`).
